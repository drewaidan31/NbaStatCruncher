# GitHub Deployment - Complete Guide

## The Issue
The current project uses Replit-specific configurations that cause build errors on external platforms. The simplest solution is to deploy using Vercel or Netlify which handle Node.js applications automatically.

## Solution: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code
1. Create a GitHub repository and push your code
2. No file modifications needed - Vercel handles the build process

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to vercel.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your repository
5. Vercel will automatically detect it as a Node.js application

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables in Vercel
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Any random string (e.g., "my-secret-key-12345")
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"

### Step 4: Database Setup
Get a free PostgreSQL database from:
- **Neon** (neon.tech) - Free tier available
- **Supabase** (supabase.com) - Free tier with PostgreSQL
- **Railway** - Includes PostgreSQL with deployment

For Neon:
1. Create account at neon.tech
2. Create new database
3. Copy connection string to Vercel's DATABASE_URL

### Step 5: Deploy
- Vercel automatically builds and deploys
- Your app will be live at a vercel.app URL
- Subsequent git pushes trigger automatic redeployments

## Alternative: Railway (Simpler)

If you prefer even less configuration:

1. Go to railway.app
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Deploy from GitHub repo
4. Railway provides PostgreSQL automatically
5. Only need to add SESSION_SECRET environment variable

## Alternative: Netlify

1. Go to netlify.com
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Set publish directory: `dist/public`
5. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard

## Why This Works
These platforms handle the build configuration automatically and don't rely on the complex vite.config setup that's causing the import errors. They detect Node.js applications and use their own optimized build processes.

## Access Your Deployed App
Once deployed, your NBA analytics platform will be fully functional with:
- Player search and statistics
- Custom stat calculator
- Guided stat builder
- Career progression charts
- Scatter plot analysis
- User authentication and saved stats

The deployment platforms handle all the technical complexity, so you can focus on using your application.
