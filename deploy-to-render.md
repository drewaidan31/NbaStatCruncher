# NBA Analytics - Render Deployment Guide

## Current Status
✅ Local development works perfectly with guest mode and 553 NBA players
✅ Database connectivity confirmed locally
✅ Guest mode allows full access without authentication
❌ Render production deployment has database connectivity issues

## Deploy to Render

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Render production deployment with database connectivity"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Render Configuration
Your `render.yaml` is configured with:
- **Build Command**: `./build.sh`
- **Start Command**: `node server/production-ready.js`
- **Health Check**: `/api/health`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with auto-generated credentials

### 3. Environment Variables (Render Dashboard)
```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=(auto-configured by Render)
SESSION_SECRET=(auto-generated)
```

### 4. Build Process
The build script will:
1. Install dependencies
2. Build frontend application
3. Run database migrations (`npm run db:push`)
4. Import NBA player data (`tsx server/setup-production-db.js`)

### 5. Production Server Features
- Direct database connection using Neon Serverless
- Simplified API routing for `/api/players` and `/api/auth/*`
- Static file serving for React frontend
- Guest mode enabled by default
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 6. Verification Steps
After deployment, check:
1. Health endpoint: `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health`
2. Players API: `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/players`
3. Frontend loads with guest mode access

### 7. Troubleshooting
If database issues persist:
- Check Render build logs for database migration errors
- Verify DATABASE_URL is properly set in environment
- Ensure PostgreSQL service is running and connected

The production server bypasses complex routing and connects directly to the database to resolve the 404 API errors you experienced.
