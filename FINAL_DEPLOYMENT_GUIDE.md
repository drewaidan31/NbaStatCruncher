# NBA Analytics - Deployment Guide

## Recommended Approach: Railway with Docker

The configuration errors you're seeing occur because deployment platforms can't resolve the Replit-specific setup. Using Railway with Docker provides the cleanest deployment path.

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "NBA Analytics Platform"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nba-analytics.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to railway.app
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway detects the Dockerfile automatically

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Add in Railway dashboard:
- `SESSION_SECRET`: `nba-analytics-secret-2025`
- Railway provides `DATABASE_URL` automatically

### Step 4: Database Setup
Railway creates PostgreSQL instance automatically. No manual setup needed.

## Alternative: Heroku
1. Create Heroku app
2. Add Heroku PostgreSQL addon
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Deploy from GitHub

## Alternative: Render
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Choose "Web Service"
3. Build command: `docker build -t app .`
4. Start command: `docker run -p $PORT:5000 app`

## Why Docker Works
- Isolates build environment
- Bypasses vite.config import issues
- Handles PostCSS configuration automatically
- Provides consistent deployment across platforms

## Expected Outcome
Your NBA analytics platform will be fully functional with:
- Player search and statistics
- Custom stat calculator with delete button
- Guided stat builder with all archetypes
- Career progression visualization
- User authentication and saved stats
- All existing functionality preserved
