# Complete Deployment Solution

## The Problem
The vite.config import error occurs because deployment platforms can't resolve the Replit-specific configuration. 

## Solution: Use Railway with Simplified Setup

### Step 1: Prepare Repository
1. Create GitHub repository with your current code
2. Replace package.json with the simplified version:
   ```bash
   mv package.json package.replit.json
   mv package.json.deploy package.json
   ```

### Step 2: Add Required Files
Create these files in your repository root:

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**railway.toml:**
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 100
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to railway.app
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Railway automatically provides PostgreSQL
4. Add environment variables:
   - SESSION_SECRET: "nba-analytics-secret-2025"
   - NODE_ENV: "production"

### Step 4: Database Setup
Railway automatically creates DATABASE_URL environment variable pointing to included PostgreSQL instance.

## Alternative: Use Render
1. Go to render.com
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Choose "Web Service"
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Start command: `npm start`
6. Add PostgreSQL database from Render dashboard

## Why This Works
- Bypasses vite.config import issues
- Uses simplified server without complex configurations
- Platforms handle Node.js applications natively
- Includes health checks for stability

## Expected Result
Your NBA analytics platform will be fully deployed with:
- Working authentication
- Player statistics and search
- Custom stat calculator with delete button
- Guided stat builder
- All existing functionality preserved
